### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Swedish business student passionate about Finance and Data Analytics.

I earned a bachelors degree in economics, with minors in mathematics and communication studies, from Rollins College in Orlando, Florida. I then went on to attain two master's degrees in Finance and Business Analytics from Hult International Business School to launch my Finance career in the US. 

I am very passionate about business, finance, and leveraging data analytics to find useful business solutions and superior retuns.

The biggest project I'm continously working on is a backtesting program for European option trading strategies in Python, incorporating the Black-Scholes pricing model and margin calls. While I won't make the code public here, I'm always interested in discussing ideas, code, problems, and solutions on the topic.
